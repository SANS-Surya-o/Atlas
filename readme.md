# Precog Recruitment Task - Atlas - Report


Create a virtual environment and activate it. 
Install required packages
```
pip install requirements.txt 
```
Every task is organised as notebooks with explanations (where possible). Task 2 has a readme.md describing the algorithms.

### Task 1 
Contains the Jupyter Notebook analysis. Run it with the env kernel. Maintain the directory sturcture as there are imports across files. 

- (Partially attempted and haphazardly documented due to lack of time. Analysis based on degree is performed but in great detail. Kindly go through it.)

### Task 2 
Contains community_detection.ipynb. The readme.md inside task2 folder has additional notes.


### Task 3 
Contains a jupyter notebook. Highly encourage running it on google colab. 
- Only Node2Vec implemented for link prediction
